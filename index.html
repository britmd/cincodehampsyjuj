      <h2 id="about"> About Cinco de Hamps y Juj </h2>
        <br>
        <p>What is there to say about one of the best events in the country.
          It all began in the Spring of 2014, where a young Haley Rose Hampton met and lived with a young Juliana Rose Goode. Not only did these two ladies share a common middle name, they also shared a birthday - May 6,1994. Arguably, one of the best days to be born on. </p>
          <p> From there a wonderful tradition was born. This tradition soon turned into one of New Orleans most widely celebrated festivals. People from around the world come to celebrate Cinco de Hamps y Juj. Often times this festival coincides with the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage festival, but we can assure you the numbers pouring into the city are for the Cinco de Hamp y Juj Fest.</p>
